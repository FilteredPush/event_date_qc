The Description:TestPass here ""The event month and day is feasible"" is a description of a validation.  The Description: Error here is a description of an amendment.  Given some problematic data (2015-14-11) In a pre-enhancement validation phase, the validation event month/day in range would be expected to be NotCompliant, then the amendment would be proposed (2015-11-14), then a post-enhancment validation phase would report Compliant on the amended data.  Under QA, if amendments are accepted, the amended record would not be filtered out.  Under QC, the amendment would be seen as a proposal to modify the source record in its database of record.  In short, this row (and other rows specifying amendments) need to be split into two, one for a validation, one for an amendment.</PJM>",,1
